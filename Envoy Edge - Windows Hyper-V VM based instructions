*** Simple Standup
To get started, we'll need to enable Hyper-V and reboot the host:  (needs to happen on both nodes)
(Run in Powershell as an Administrator)
 
```
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```
 
Once the host reboots, run the following line:
 
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
```
 
From there, download (this script)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yXnkMZB8zug1Uu0Z7Si-SQj0DgCIkPjH/view?usp=sharing] and run as follows:

On the node: 
```
& '.\Download and Run.ps1' -apiKey "<your Rhapsody api-key>" -nodeName "<your node name>" -engineName "<your node name>"
```

where `<your node name>` is less than 40 characters long and contains only lower-case letters, numbers, and dashes.
